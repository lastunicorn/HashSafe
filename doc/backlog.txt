HashSafe
========

Compare two timestamps
----------------------
As a user when I type "hash compare <timestamp1> <timestamp2>"
I want to see a list with the differences between the results from the two timestamps (new, deleted, modified files)
so that I am able to easily spot the modified files between the two timestamps.

Compare timestamp with current
------------------------------
As a user when I perform a comparison and I provide only a single timestamp
I want the application to perform a new scan and compare it with the provided one
so that I am able to easily spot the modified files between the specified timestamp and the current state of the files.
