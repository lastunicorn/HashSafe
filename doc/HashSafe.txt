Command Line Prompter
=====================

The prompter text
-----------------

One can provide a custom prompter text that can be static (will be the same until the end of the program) or it can be build based on some custom data.
Out of the box there is a StaticPrompterText that can be configured to provide a static text.
For a dynamic text one must create a custom implementation of the IPrompterText interface.

Provide a static prompter text:
	commandLinePrompt.PrompterText = new StaticPrompterText { Text = "HashSafe> " }
	
Provide a custom implementation of the IPrompterText interface to have more control over the displayed prompter text.


The selection of commands
-------------------------

Each command must implement its own algorithm for parsing a request and decide if it can handle it.
The CommandLinePrompter will interrogate each command one by one and will use the first one that says it can handle the request.
